        <p>NFTs allow you to buy and sell ownership of unique digital items and keep track of who owns them using the blockchain. NFT stands for “non-fungible token,” and it can technically contain anything digital, including drawings, animated GIFs, songs, or items in video games. An NFT can either be one-of-a-kind, like a real-life painting, or one copy of many, like trading cards, but the blockchain keeps track of who has ownership of the file.

            NFTs have been making headlines lately, some selling for millions of dollars, with high-profile memes like Nyan Cat and the “deal with it” sunglasses being put up for auction. There’s also a lot of discussion about the massive electricity use and environmental impacts of NFTs.</p>

       <td>Airdrop</td>
       <td>An airdrop refers to sending cryptocurrency coins/ tokens or NFTs for free to different wallet addresses. Some NFT projects may airdrop free companion NFTs to reward the original NFT collection holders. In addition, it can be used as a marketing strategy for NFT/ crypto-related projects to generate attention and new followers. For example, in August 2021, NFT collection “Bored Ape Yacht Club” holders were airdropped a “mutant serum”, which allowed them to mint a free Mutant Ape in the likeness of their original form can be freely traded. The floor price for one Mutant Ape is now sitting at 6.3ETH (as per December 2021)</td>

          <td>AMA is an abbreviation for “ask me anything”, it is used by people who are opening themselves up for a session where the community can ask any kind of question. Many NFT projects hold live AMA sections regularly to keep up the engagement with their NFT holders.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Ape in</td>
        <td>Ape in usually refers to people who rush into buying a new NFT or coin without doing much due diligence or research. Originated through the ‘apes together strong’ meme. It is, however, always advised not to ape in any projects without having proper research and understanding on what you’re buying! Unless you are a true degen (see below what degen is)!</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Copy Cat</td>
        <td>It originally refers to a person who copies another person’s ideas, appearance or behaviour, in the NFT world, it means a knock-off project which copies another more popular project.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>DAO</td>
        <td>Decentralized Autonomous Organization. DAOs are not governed by one single person or entity. The rules and governance of each DAO are coded in smart contracts on the blockchain and cannot be changed unless voted upon by the members of the DAO. More and more recent NFT/ Metaverse projects are setting up DAO treasury in which the fund is collected from their NFT sales, and holders can decide how to use the treasury and future project direction, etc. Decentraland DAO is one of the examples.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Degen</td>
        <td>Degen is short for “degenerate”, usually refers to people who often make risky and bad bets. In the crypto space, it can refer to people who invest in digital assets like NFTs without doing due diligence.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Floor price</td>
        <td>Floor price means the lowest price listed of an NFT project. It doesn’t necessarily mean you should always buy NFTs at floor price as most of them are usually in lower ranking in rarity, it however, is a good entry point for new joiners for the project.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
          <td>Floor is lava</td>
          <td>“Floor is lava” originally comes from a game kids play to avoid touching the floor at all costs. It also became a meme people used to describe the things in life we try to avoid. Since “floor” is short for “floor price” in the NFT world, “floor is lava” refers to “avoiding the low price”, which means the floor price is rising.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Floor sweeping</td>
        <td>It refers to someone or a group of people who keeps buying the NFTs, which are listed at the lowest price.

    <tr>
        <td>FOMO</td>
        <td>FOMO is short for “fear of missing out”, it’s to describe people (especially newbies in the space) rushing into buying an asset just because they see many other people are doing so/ talking about it, without doing much due diligence. However, as sophisticated investors, we should always avoid FOMO and keep our heads cool before investing in anything.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>FUD</td>
        <td>FUD is short for “fear, uncertainty and doubt”. FUD is commonly seen when the price of a coin/ NFT project dropping, or when there is some sort of negative news or rumours. People tend to panic sell their assets when there is FUD. Being logical and a bit doubtful is important for making the right investment decision, it however, is not very wise to let your emotions take over as a lot of people make the worst investment decisions when they are emotionally investing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Mint</td>
        <td>The meaning of “mint” is “produce for the first time”. In the NFT world, minting refers to the creation of a new NFT.</td>
